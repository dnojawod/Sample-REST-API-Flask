# Sample-REST-API-Flask
>The program is a REST API application that can perform HTTP Requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to send and receive information in JSON. It is built using the Python language and the Flask framework. The data being accessed is stored in a database called api and a table named books which contains information about books with the attributes id, title, author, and description. The user can perform GET requests to access book information which are translated in JSON format and filter results using desired parameters. The user can also perform POST requests to send data by providing a request body in JSON format which will be stored in the database. The PUT request allows the user to make changes from existing data by providing a request body in JSON containing the information of changes to be made with the id attribute used to distinguish the book to be updated. To delete an existing book, the DELETE request will perform such task by providing parameters to filter and delete the desired data. An application called Postman is used to easily perform HTTP requests and test the REST API application while MySQL Workbench is used to develop and visualize the database.
